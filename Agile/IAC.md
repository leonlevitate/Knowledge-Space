## Infrastructure as Code

- Helps us avoid cloud deployment inconsistencies
- Increases Developer productivity
- Lowers Costs

It's fairly easy to spin up simple cloud architectures, but mistakes can be made provisioning complex ones, due to human error. The way to avoid these kinds of errors is through automation, and **Infrastructure as Code** helps engineers to automatically launch cloud environments quickly.

Historically, setting up IT infrastructure has been a very manual, physical process (racking and stacking servers). Rise of cloud computing addresses many of the problems:

- No need to rack and stack servers, which reduces human capital and costs
- Servers, databases can be spun up quickly, allows scalability.

However the configuration consistency issue still exists, where manual setup of cloud infrastructure can lead to discrepancies.

Hence **Infrastructure as Code (woohoo)!**

"Infrastructure as code is an approach to managing IT infrastructure for the age of the cloud, microservices, and continuous delivery." - Kief Morris, Head of Continuous Delivery for ThoughtWorks Europe.

So this allows us to streamline/remove standard operating procedures and manual processes. Basically treating servers, databases and networks like software. This code will help us configure and deploy infrastructure components quickly and consistently.

**Even more benefits (yay)**:

- Decreased chance of incompatibility issues with infrastructure, helping applications to run smoothly.
- Code can be version-controlled which serves as form of documentation.
- Configurations can be tested, just like code.
- IAC allows company to use Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment techniques and minimise human errors after the development stage.
- Can also spin down environments when not in use - keeps everything clean, organised and low-cost.
